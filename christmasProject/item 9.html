		  <p>The Price of a ps5 is $499.99 in the USA, Â£479.99 in the UK, and $749.99 in Australia.</p>
      <p>PS5 is&nbsp; first and foremost, a games console, but like the PS4 it will also play host to a range of different multimedia apps.
It has a customized SSD that loads games much faster than either PS4 model's HDD. The PS5 plays games in 4K and is capable of displaying up to 120 frames per second, though you'll need a compatible TV or monitor to take advantage of that.</p>
